# Style Guide

1. **All FAQ titles should be posed as a question.** This is an FA**Q**, after all.
1. **Keep explanations to 'the same level' as that of the question.** For example, an answer to the question 'what is UB?' should not involve a lengthy discussion of how the C++ memory model's forward progress guarantees treat infinite loops with no side effects.
1. **Link to external resources.** Give the reader a place to learn more, rather than overwhelming them with information.
1. **Articles should only do one thing.** For example, 'what is an iterator' and 'how do I implement an iterator' should be separate articles. Note that this isn't a prescription on how long an article should be - some topics will require more explanation than others.
