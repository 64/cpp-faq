Useful for indicating where a range starts and ends.\nnote: An iterator itself mustn\u0026rsquo;t have begin/end functions as it\u0026rsquo;s container\u0026rsquo;s responsibility to handle these functions.\ncategories of an iterator: there are 5 iterators in C++ defined by the standard as:\n  input iterator: input iterator is a single direction iterator and read only means you can only increment it and read from it. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the simplest iterators. Usually used for reading from input streams like files in read only mode, stdin.\n  output iterator: same as input iterator, output iterator is a single direction iterator, but can only used for writing to a stream.\n  forward iterator: forward iterator is a single direction iterator that can be used for both reading and writing, usually used in containers like std::forward_list.\n  bidirectional iterator: bidirectional iterator is just a forward iterator that can be moved to both direction incrementing, decrementing\n  random access iterator: random access iterator is a bidirectional iterator that can be moved to any direction means if you want to access to the Nth element of a sequence you can just do auto Nth_Value = container.begin() + N; unlike previous iterators where you should increment N times. Random access iterator is the hardest and yet most powerful iterator since it supports all of the previously mentioned iterators.\n  contiguous iterator (since C++20): contiguous iterator is a random access iterator where the elements it points to are contiguously ordered in the memory\n  conclusion: In brief Contiguous Iterator is a superset of a Random Access Iterator which is a superset of a Bidirectional Iterator a Forward Iterator and a input/output iterator.\niterator vs pointer: As discussed earlier an iterator is just an abstraction of a pointer, but with more consistency (i.e we can\u0026rsquo;t just use pointers for iterating over a linked list as it\u0026rsquo;s not contiguous and lead to UB, but we instead create a custom iterator and move the current stored pointer to some node to the next node if the location has changed). pointer:\nint main() { const int N = 2; int arr[] = {6, 8, 5, 6}; auto first = arr; // first points to the first element of arr: 6  first++; // can be incremented  ++first; first--; // decremented  --first; use(*first); // deferenceced  use(first[N]); // same as use(*(first + N))  first += N; // re-assigned to point to another location  first -= N; } RAI (Random Access Iterator):\nint main() { const int N = 2; std::vector\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; vec{6, 8, 5, 6}; auto first = vec.begin(); first++; ++first; first--; --first; use(*first); use(first[N]); first += N; first -= N; } ","permalink":"https://64.github.io/cpp-faq/iterators/","summary":"Iterators provide a unified API for accessing different containers.

For example, we can call a function that takes an int with a const int argument, which copies its value. For parameters which are passed by value, some of these conversions rules are called decay. They are called decay because in most cases, some type information is lost, such as the size of an array or the const qualifier in our example.\nArray-to-Pointer Conversion A commonly known form of decay is array-to-pointer conversion:\n// We seemingly accept an array by value as our parameter: void print_size(char arr[128]) { // warning: \u0026#39;sizeof\u0026#39; on array function parameter \u0026#39;arr\u0026#39;  // will return size of \u0026#39;char *\u0026#39; [-Wsizeof-array-argument]  std::cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; sizeof(arr) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39;; } Sample output: 8\nWe have attempted to specify that our print_size should accept an array with size 128 of char by value as its function parameter. However, arrays cannot be passed by value and instead decay to pointers. So from the compiler\u0026rsquo;s point of view, our function signature is equal to:\nvoid print_size(char *arr); Using sizeof with arrays that have decayed to a pointer is a common source of bugs, as in the above example, where we obtain the size of a pointer, which is less than the size of the entire array. Thankfully, GCC and clang warn us about this.\nFunction-to-Pointer conversion Another very similar form of decay is function-to-pointer conversion:\nvoid call(void callback(int), int x) { callback(x); } Here, our first function parameter appears to be another function callback, which takes an int and returns nothing. However, just as an array, the function callback decays to a pointer. It would be equivalent to write:\nvoid call(void (*callback)(int), int x) { callback(x); } The danger of misuse is not as great here; decay simply gives us a nicer syntax for accepting function pointers.\nDiscarding const/volatile qualifiers and removing references This form of decay is something that you have likely understood already by intuition. When we accept a type T as a parameter to our function by value, we don\u0026rsquo;t care whether the arguments were const, volatile, references, other values, etc. Inside of the function, we are simply using T.\nThis form of decay can be seen in the following examples:\nvoid use_int(int my_int) { /* ... */ } int main() { // Calling use_int with a literal of type int:  use_int(3); // Calling use_int with a const volatile int: This copies the value of x.  // const and volatile are discarded, so inside of use_int,  // we don\u0026#39;t care that the argument was const or volatile.  const volatile int x = 7; use_int(x); // Calling use_int with an int\u0026amp; copies the referenced value:  // Inside of use_int, we don\u0026#39;t see or care that the argument was a reference.  int y = 5; int \u0026amp;yref = y; use_int(y); } Using std::decay The documentation of the std::decay type trait lists all these decay conversions. std::decay can be used to simulate them and there is also a templated type alias std::decay_t for convenience. Here are a few examples:\n// no decay std::decay_t\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; -\u0026gt; int // discarding references std::decay_t\u0026lt;int\u0026amp;\u0026gt; -\u0026gt; int // discarding references and const qualifier std::decay_t\u0026lt;const int\u0026amp;\u0026gt; -\u0026gt; int // discarding volatile std::decay_t\u0026lt;volatile int\u0026gt; -\u0026gt; int // array-to-pointer std::decay_t\u0026lt;int[8]\u0026gt; -\u0026gt; int* // array-to-pointer, and also discarding the reference std::decay_t\u0026lt;int(\u0026amp;)[8]\u0026gt; -\u0026gt; int* // function-to-pointer std::decay_t\u0026lt;int(int)\u0026gt; -\u0026gt; int(*)(int) ","permalink":"https://64.github.io/cpp-faq/decay/","summary":"When we call functions in C++, our arguments may need to undergo type conversions.
